Atmospheric science is an interdisciplinary field of study that integrates different aspects of physics and chemistry to examine the composition and behavior of Earth's atmosphere. Mathematical tools as well as powerful computer systems, are used to evaluate the physical and chemical relationships that describe the functioning of the atmosphere. By knowing these things, you can understand where we interest in computer science, programming language, physics and mathematics originates from. These intricacies in atmospheric science have completely fascinated us and made us step on this path. We don't think it's too radical to say that AI modeling is a game changer in air quality modeling in the next decade and could replace numerical modeling.
We have implemented a novel coupled model based on machine learning for forecasting Meteorology and Air Quality. We are currently working on forecasting PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and Meteorological Parameters of Tehran, Iran. The second version will be released on November 20, 2023.
